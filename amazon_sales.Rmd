# What is Amazon trying to solve?

Amazon wants to boost revenue and reduce subscription cancellations.

# How? 
Use sales and customer data to uncover key patterns and recommend actions
* Understand what drives product revenue
* Identify churn trends in subscriptions
* Segment and analyze customer behavior
* Provide data-driven recommendations

# Revenue by product category

## Who are the best customers (based on CLTV)?

```{r cltv}
cltv <- sales_data %>%
  group_by(customer_id) %>%
  summarise(total_spent = sum(total_price)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_spent))

head(cltv, 10)

ggplot(cltv, aes(x = total_spent)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "#638ECB", color = "white", bins = 10) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Customer Lifetime Value",
       x = "Total Spent", y = "Number of Customers") +
  theme_minimal()
  


```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

buyer_counts <- sales_data %>%
  group_by(customer_id) %>%
  summarise(purchase_count = n()) %>%
  mutate(buyer_type = ifelse(purchase_count == 1, "One-Time", "Repeat")) %>%
  count(buyer_type)

ggplot(buyer_counts, aes(x = "", y = n, fill = buyer_type)) +
  geom_col(width = 1, color = "white") +
  coord_polar(theta = "y") +

  theme_void() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("One-Time" = "#B1C9EF", "Repeat" = "#638ECB"))  # blue palette

```


## Customer Purchase Behavior

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Categorize customers into tiers

  group_by(customer_id) %>%
  summarise(purchase_count = n()) %>%
  mutate(tier = case_when(
    purchase_count == 1 ~ "One-Time",
    purchase_count <= 3 ~ "Low Frequency (2â€“3)",
    purchase_count <= 5 ~ "Mid Frequency (4â€“5)",
    purchase_count >= 6 ~ "High Frequency (6+)"
  )) %>%
  count(tier)

# Plot pie chart
ggplot(frequency_tiers, aes(x = "", y = n, fill = tier)) +
  geom_col(width = 1, color = "white") +
  coord_polar(theta = "y") +
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(round(n/sum(n)*100), "%")),
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5), color = "white", size = 5) +
  labs(title = "Customer Purchase Frequency Segments",
       fill = "Purchase Tier") +
  theme_void() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(
    "One-Time" = "#B1C9EF",           # Light blue
    "Low Frequency (2â€“3)" = "#aed6f1",# Deep blue
    "Mid Frequency (4â€“5)" = "#a9cce3",# Lemon green
    "High Frequency (6+)" = "#3498db" # Sunset orange
  ))

```


ðŸ“‰ Where is churn highest?
Note: This plot includes only customers who have churned
```{r churn-time-analysis}
customer_data %>%
  filter(!is.na(subscription_end)) %>%
  mutate(churn_duration = as.numeric(subscription_end - subscription_start)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(churn_duration)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, fill = "#aed6f1", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Churn Duration (in Days)",
       x = "Days until Churn", y = "Number of Customers")

# Insights

* Focus on High-Revenue Categories: Wellness & Electronics contribute the   most to revenue â€” prioritize them in promotions.
* Target Mid & High-Frequency Buyers: 49% of repeat customers buy 4+ times   ideal for personalized offers or exclusive deals.
* Improve Retention in Basic Tier: Highest churn rate observed â€” consider   loyalty rewards or simplified upgrade options.
* Encourage More Product Reviews:High-rated products generate less      revenue; incentivize honest reviews to balance perceptions and drive conversions.
* Monitor Low-Rated Price Ranges: Low-rated products are priced high (avg â‚¹139) â€” reassess pricing or quality to reduce customer dissatisfaction.

These insights will guide Amazon to tweak pricing strategy, improve subscription tiers, and enhance product targeting.
