# Amazon-Sales-Subscription-Analysis
This project explores key business KPIs using real-world simulated data from an e-commerce platform (Amazon-like), focusing on customer retention, purchase behavior, and product performance. The objective was to identify hidden patterns and guide strategic decisions on product pricing, subscription models, and customer segmentation.
Tools & Technologies
SQL • R (dplyr, ggplot2) • Excel • Tableau • PowerPoint

Key Analyses Performed
Churn Rate by Subscription Tier: Calculated churn using subscription_end dates; found highest drop-off in Basic tier.
Customer Type Segmentation: Categorized One-Time vs Repeat Buyers; 78% are repeat — further segmented by order frequency.
Revenue by Product Category: Wellness and Electronics contributed the most to overall revenue.
Product Rating vs Price Analysis: Low-rated products surprisingly had higher average prices — highlighting misaligned pricing strategies.
Retention Strategy Design: Insights used to propose loyalty programs and pricing revisions.

Impact
Revealed pricing inefficiencies in low-rated products
Recommended promotions focused on top revenue-driving categories
Helped simulate a retention model for converting Basic tier customers
